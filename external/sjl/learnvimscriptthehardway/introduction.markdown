[Learn Vimscript the Hard Way][book] is a book for users of the [Vim][] editor
who want to learn how to customize Vim.

It is *not* a guide to *using* Vim.  Before reading this book you should be
comfortable editing text in Vim and know what terms like "buffer", "window" and
"insert mode" mean.

The book is divided roughly into three sections:

* The first covers basic Vim commands that you can use in your `~/.vimrc` file
  to customize Vim quickly and easily.
* The second looks more deeply at Vimscript as a programming language, covering
  things like variables, comparisons, and functions.
* The third walks through the creation of a sample plugin intended for
  distribution to other Vim users.
